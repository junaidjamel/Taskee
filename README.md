## Architecture

Taskee follows **Clean Architecture** with a clear separation of concerns across three layers:

- **Data** — Hive local data sources, Hive models, and mappers
- **Domain** — Pure Dart entities, repository interfaces, and use cases
- **Presentation** — Bloc/Cubit for state management, pages, and widgets
